## Explanation:

This code creates a real-time character counter for a text input field. Here's a summary in 8-10 lines:

`HTML`:

* The HTML sets up a web page with a container for the character counter.
* It includes a textarea input field where users can type text, and two paragraphs to display the total characters and remaining characters.

`CSS`:

* The CSS defines the styling and layout of the web page, including fonts, colors, and responsiveness.
* It provides an appealing background and styles for input elements and text.

`JavaScript`:

* The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the web page.
* It listens for input events on the textarea and updates the character count in real-time.
* The total character count and remaining character count are displayed and updated as the user types.

In summary, this web application allows users to count the characters in their text input in real-time, helping them stay within a specified character limit. It provides a visually appealing interface with character count animations.
